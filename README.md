# Key Challenges & Solutions

| Task management logic      | Dynamically created and tracked tasks using JavaScript arrays and event delegation to optimize performance. |
| Design consistency         | Built wireframes in Figma and maintained consistency with spacing, margins, and font hierarchies throughout. |
